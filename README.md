We've choosen the [Racing-Car-Katas Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Racing-Car-Katas) to train us to break dependencies that make code hard to test. We did the same exercise (_TirePressureMonitoringSystem_) over and over trying different techniques at each working session. Here the rules we've set for each session:

- Don't modify `Sensor` class
- Proceed with tiny safe refactorings
- Minimize changes in `Alarm` class
- Evaluate the impact of implemented refactoring
- Finally test suite for `Alarm` class
- Slow down. Focus on doing it right
