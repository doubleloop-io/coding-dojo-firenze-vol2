Intro slides here: [Coding Dojo](https://github.com/doubleloop-io/coding-dojo-firenze-vol1/blob/master/slides/coding-dojo.pdf) 

We've choosen the [Racing-Car-Katas Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Racing-Car-Katas) to train us to break dependencies that make code hard to test. The focus was on to use the same execrcise (_TirePressureMonitoringSystem_) and try different tecniques at each working session. Here the rules we've set for the session:

- Don't modify Sensor class
- Proceed with tiny safe refactoring
- Minimize changes in Alarm class
- Evaluate the impact of implemented refactoring
- Finally test suite for Alarm class
- Slow down. Focus on doing it right
